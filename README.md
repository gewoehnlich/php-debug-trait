# php-debug-trait

just some module to quickly debug php code
most likely i will find something that would do the job better later
but it will work for now

to-do list:
-----------

1) the file should be created, if it doesn't exist
2) convert() should convert every possible datatype to a string
3) log() should be written in a nice format
4) write 100% tests
